# sneaky-image

sneaky-image is a serverless function for generating fast placeholder images

## Usage

To generate an image, you need to modify the two path parameters at the end of the URL. The first parameter is width, the second is height.
If you wanted to generate a 200 x 200 image for example, you'd do `https://sneaky-image.now.sh/200/200`.
